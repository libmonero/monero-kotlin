/**
 * The send path of the light wallet against a live monero-lws: a wallet with a seed, which has its spend key,
 * creates transactions through the RingCT construction of monero-cpp, relays them, and both wallets read the exact
 * movement of the funds. It needs the monero-lws of src/test/integration/docker-compose.yml, on the regtest node
 * behind it, and mines onto whatever chain it finds, so it also stands on its own on a fresh chain, where it
 * mines the first block itself: a wallet that is created on the chain of only a genesis block keeps the height
 * that it found, which is the one that it has scanned, so a sync after the blocks that the test mines for it
 * fetches nothing. It runs second, after MoneroWalletLightIntegrationTest, which the order annotation of
 * junit-platform.properties makes sure of, because that test needs the fresh database of the server. The blocks it mines give the wallet its decoys: every
 * output of a regtest chain is a coinbase, which spends only sixty blocks after it was mined, so the test mines
 * enough of them for sixteen to be spendable in every ring. Set the environment variable
 * MONERO_KOTLIN_TEST_LWS_URI to the URI of the server when it is not the one of that file; the node it mines on is
 * the one of MONERO_C_TEST_DAEMON_URI. The test skips when no server answers, like the unit tests skip without
 * monero-c, which this test also needs.
