/**
 * Models a connection to a daemon or to a wallet RPC server, and talks to the server.
 *
 * The fields are the configuration of the connection and what is known of the server. The functions that talk to the server, or
 * that keep something for the connection (the credentials, the attributes), use a handle of monero-c, which is made the first time
 * that one of them is called. A connection that is only used as the configuration of a daemon or a wallet never makes one.
 * [close] releases the handle. The connection can be used after that, and makes a new one.
 *
 * If a field of the configuration (the URI, the credentials, the proxy, the priority, the timeout or the verification of the
 * certificate) changes after the handle was made, the next call makes a new handle with the new configuration, and what the old one
 * had is gone: the attributes, and the state of the server that [checkConnection] found. [setCredentials] keeps them.
 *
 * It can be used by several threads. [close] waits for the calls that are running.
