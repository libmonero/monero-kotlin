# Android

The library for Android: an AAR with the sources of the JVM library, compiled against the Android SDK, and the native library of
monero-c for `arm64-v8a` (devices) and `x86_64` (the emulator).

The module is not part of the default build, because it needs the Android SDK and the native library: add it with `-Pandroid`.

## The native library

`libmonero_c.so` is not in this repository. monero-c builds it for Android and releases it as `monero-native-android-<version>.aar`, with
both ABIs, aligned for devices with 16 KB pages. Download that archive from the
[releases of monero-c](https://github.com/libmonero/monero-c/releases) (the version of the submodule, or a later one with the same ABI) and
point the build at it with `-Pmonero.c.android.native=<path>`, or with the environment variable `MONERO_C_ANDROID_NATIVE`. The value can
also be a folder with `arm64-v8a/libmonero_c.so` and `x86_64/libmonero_c.so`, e.g. for a library that you built.

## Build and publish

```
ANDROID_HOME=<sdk> ./gradlew -Pandroid -Pmonero.c.android.native=<path> :android:assembleRelease
ANDROID_HOME=<sdk> ./gradlew -Pandroid -Pmonero.c.android.native=<path> :android:publishToMavenLocal
```

Published as `org.libmonero:monero-kotlin-android` at the version of the library, with the dependencies of the POM (Jackson and the Android
artifact of JNA). An Android app consumes it with:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenLocal()
}

dependencies {
    implementation("org.libmonero:monero-kotlin-android:<version>")
}
```

The library loads on Android unchanged: `MoneroNative` asks JNA for `monero_c`, and JNA finds it in the `lib/<abi>` of the app, where the
AAR put it. An app that minifies gets the rules that JNA needs from the AAR.

An app that bundles its own `libmonero_c.so` next to the AAR meets a duplicate file when the native libraries are merged, which its
packaging resolves:

```kotlin
android {
    packaging {
        jniLibs {
            pickFirsts += "**/libmonero_c.so"
        }
    }
}
```

## Requirements

- Android SDK with the platform 35 (compile) and its build tools; `ANDROID_HOME` set, or `sdk.dir` in `local.properties`.
- `minSdk` 28: the native library needs the bionic iconv of Android 9.
