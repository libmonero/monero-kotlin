A Kotlin library for creating Monero applications using RPC and a C ABI to [monero v0.18.5.3 'Fluorine Fermi'](https://github.com/monero-project/monero/tree/v0.18.5.3).

* Supports a daemon RPC client.
* Daemon implementations are interchangeable by conforming to a [common interface](src/main/kotlin/monero/daemon/MoneroDaemon.kt).
* Uses a clearly defined [data model and API specification](https://github.com/everoddandeven/monero-python/blob/main/docs/monero-spec.pdf) intended to be intuitive and robust.
* Fetch and process binary data from the daemon (e.g. raw blocks).
* Receive notifications when blocks are added to the chain.
* Over 800 passing unit tests of the data model.

## Architecture

<p align="center">
	<img width="85%" height="auto" src="docs/architecture.png"/><br>
	<i>Build Kotlin applications using RPC or the C ABI of <a href="https://github.com/libmonero/monero-c">monero-c</a> to <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/monero">monero-project/monero</a>.  Daemon implementations are interchangeable by conforming to a common interface, <a href="src/main/kotlin/monero/daemon/MoneroDaemon.kt">MoneroDaemon</a>.</i>
</p>

The calls are blocking. The call itself is made by monero-c, and the library runs the calls of a daemon one after the other on a thread of its own, so a call does not depend on the thread that makes it. A daemon holds a native handle: close it to release it.

## Sample code

```kotlin
// connect to daemon
MoneroDaemonRpc("http://localhost:38081", "superuser", "abctesting123").use { daemon ->
    val height = daemon.getHeight()                              // 1523651
    val txsInPool = daemon.getTxPool()                           // get transactions in the pool

    // get a block and its transactions
    val block = daemon.getBlockByHeight(height - 1)
    val txs = daemon.getTxs(block.txHashes.orEmpty())

    // receive notifications when blocks are added to the chain
    daemon.addListener(object : MoneroDaemonListener() {
        override fun onBlockHeader(header: MoneroBlockHeader) {
            val newHeight = header.height
            val hash = header.hash
        }
    })

    // or wait for the next block
    val header = daemon.waitForNextBlockHeader()
}

// read and write the data model as the JSON of monero-cpp and monero-c
val block = MoneroJson.deserialize<MoneroBlock>(json)
val fee = block.txs?.first()?.fee      // atomic units
val written = MoneroJson.serialize(block)
```

## Documentation

* [Data model and API specification](https://github.com/everoddandeven/monero-python/blob/main/docs/monero-spec.pdf)
* [Unit tests](src/test/kotlin)
* [monero-java Javadoc](https://woodser.github.io/monero-java/javadocs/index.html) and [monero-ts documentation](https://github.com/woodser/monero-ts#documentation) provide additional documentation which translates to monero-kotlin

## Using monero-kotlin in your project

monero-kotlin is not published to a repository yet, so until then build it from source as described below and add the jar from `build/libs` to your project, with its dependencies, for Gradle:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(files("libs/monero-kotlin-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"))
    implementation("com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.17.2")
    implementation("net.java.dev.jna:jna:5.15.0")
}
```

The shared library of monero-c has to be loadable too, see below.

You need a daemon to connect to:

1. Download and install [Monero CLI](https://web.getmonero.org/downloads/).
2. Start monerod, e.g.: `./monerod --stagenet` (or use a remote daemon).

## Using monero-kotlin on Android

The android module packages the same sources of the library with the native library of monero-c
for arm64-v8a as an AAR: an app gets the library, `libmonero_c.so` and JNA's Android artifact in
one dependency. The library loads unchanged on Android: `MoneroNative` asks JNA for `monero_c`,
which resolves `libmonero_c.so` from the `lib/arm64-v8a` of the app, where the AAR put it.

The module is published to the local maven repository until it is published elsewhere, so publish
it first and depend on it:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("org.libmonero:monero-kotlin-android:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

The app needs `minSdk` 28, which is the floor of the native library: the bionic iconv that
boost.locale needs was introduced in Android 9. A light wallet opens against a light wallet
server the way it does on the JVM:

```kotlin
val config = MoneroWalletConfig()
config.networkType = MoneroNetworkType.MAINNET
config.primaryAddress = "..."
config.privateViewKey = "..."
val wallet = MoneroWalletLight.createWallet(config, MoneroRpcConnection("http://10.0.2.2:8443"))
wallet.use {
    println(wallet.getPrimaryAddress())   // the account the server registered
    wallet.sync()                         // the blocks the server scanned for it
    println(wallet.getBalance())          // atomic units
}
```

`examples/android` is a complete example: an activity that opens the light wallet of an account,
syncs it and reads its balance. Its build fields default to the throwaway regtest account of the
integration tests and to the light wallet server of the compose of `src/test/integration`, which
an emulator reaches from the host with `adb reverse tcp:8443 tcp:8443` (the compose is plain
HTTP, so the example allows cleartext to it; a server on the internet should be HTTPS). Build it
with `./gradlew -Pandroid :examples:android:assembleDebug` and read `android/README.md` for how
the native library is pointed at, since it is not part of the repository.

The light wallet calls above need a `libmonero_c.so` that has the light wallet functions of the C
ABI, which the submodule pin does not have yet: the PR that adds them to monero-c is queued for
review. Until it lands, build the artifact of the android job from the light wallet branch of
monero-c, or point `-Pmonero.c.android.library` at a cross-build of it.

## Building monero-kotlin from source

You need a JDK 21.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/libmonero/monero-kotlin.git
cd monero-kotlin
./gradlew build
```

The jar is in `build/libs`. The build does not need monero-c, so it does not need the submodule: `external/monero-c` is [monero-c](https://github.com/libmonero/monero-c), the C library that `MoneroDaemonRpc` calls.

## Downloading monero-c

The [releases of monero-c](https://github.com/libmonero/monero-c/releases) have the library of every platform: Linux (x86_64 and arm64), Windows and macOS (arm64 and x86_64). Download the archive of your platform and unpack it: the library is `libmonero_c.so`, `libmonero_c.dylib` or `libmonero_c.dll` in the directory of the archive, which also has the libraries that it needs, e.g. libusb.

## Building monero-c from source

### Linux and macOS

1. Clone the project repository with its submodules, which are big:
   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/libmonero/monero-kotlin.git
   ```
2. Build monero-project, monero-cpp and monero-c, which takes a long time the first time:
   ```sh
   cd monero-kotlin/external/monero-c
   ./bin/build_libmonero_c.sh
   ```

The library is left in `external/monero-c/build`: `libmonero_c.so` on Linux and `libmonero_c.dylib` on macOS.

### Windows

1. Download and install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
2. Press the Windows button and launch `MSYS2 MINGW64`.
3. Update packages: `pacman -Syu` and confirm at prompts.
4. Relaunch MSYS2 (if necessary) and install dependencies:
   ```
   pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium mingw-w64-x86_64-hidapi mingw-w64-x86_64-unbound mingw-w64-x86_64-protobuf mingw-w64-x86_64-libusb mingw-w64-x86_64-expat mingw-w64-x86_64-ntldd git make gettext base-devel wget
   wget https://repo.msys2.org/mingw/mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-icu-76.1-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
   pacman -U mingw-w64-x86_64-icu-76.1-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
   wget https://repo.msys2.org/mingw/mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-boost-1.87.0-3-any.pkg.tar.zst
   pacman -U mingw-w64-x86_64-boost-1.87.0-3-any.pkg.tar.zst
   ```
5. Clone the project repository with its submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/libmonero/monero-kotlin.git`
6. Build monero-project, monero-cpp and monero-c:
   ```
   cd monero-kotlin/external/monero-c
   ./bin/build_libmonero_c.sh
   ```

### Loading the native library

The library is loaded the first time that a daemon is made. Set the system property `monero.c.library` or the environment variable `MONERO_C_LIBRARY` to the path of the library, e.g.:

```sh
MONERO_C_LIBRARY=/path/to/monero-kotlin/external/monero-c/build/libmonero_c.so ./myapp
```

Otherwise it is looked for as `monero_c` by [JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna): in `jna.library.path`, in the library path of the system, and in the resources of the classpath (e.g. `linux-x86-64/libmonero_c.so`).

When it is loaded, the version of its ABI is compared with the one that monero-kotlin was written for (0.1.x), and a `MoneroError` is thrown if it is not the same.

## Running tests

### Unit tests

The unit tests read and write the JSON of the models, which is the JSON that monero-c writes, in [src/test/resources/fixtures](src/test/resources/fixtures). They need no node. The ones that call monero-c, e.g. the utils, are skipped when its library is not found. To run them, set the environment variable `MONERO_C_LIBRARY` to the library, built as described above:

```sh
./gradlew test
MONERO_C_LIBRARY=/path/to/monero-kotlin/external/monero-c/build/libmonero_c.so ./gradlew test --rerun
```

Gradle does not run the tests again when only the environment changed, so add `--rerun` after setting or unsetting the variable.

### Integration tests

The integration tests are tagged `integration`, so `./gradlew test` does not run them. They need monero-c and a regtest node with a monero-lws server, which is the `docker-compose.yml` of the integration tests:

```sh
docker compose -f src/test/integration/docker-compose.yml up -d
MONERO_C_LIBRARY=/path/to/monero-kotlin/external/monero-c/build/libmonero_c.so ./gradlew integrationTest --rerun
docker compose -f src/test/integration/docker-compose.yml down -v
```

The node is expected at `http://127.0.0.1:18081`: set the environment variable `MONERO_C_TEST_DAEMON_URI` for another one. The monero-lws server is expected at `http://127.0.0.1:8443`: set the environment variable `MONERO_KOTLIN_TEST_LWS_URI` for another one. The light wallet tests need a monero-c with the light wallet surface, which the submodule does not have yet: they skip with a message when the library has no light wallet.

To get the coverage of the library:

```sh
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```

The report is in `build/reports/jacoco/test`: `html/index.html`, and `jacocoTestReport.xml`, which is the one that Codacy reads.

## Continuous integration

* **Build** builds the library and the unit tests, uploads the unit tests, with the files they need to run (`./gradlew unitTests`), and collects the coverage of the unit tests.
* **Native** builds monero-c from the submodule `external/monero-c` on Linux (x86_64 and arm64), Windows and macOS (arm64 and x86_64), with the recipes of the Build workflows of monero-c. The library is kept in the cache of Actions with the commit of the submodule in the key, so it is built again only when the submodule changes.
* **Unit tests** waits for the Build and Native runs of the same commit, and runs the unit tests that Build made on the same platforms, with the library that Native built, without building anything.
* **Integration tests** waits for the same runs, starts the regtest node of monero-c, and runs the tests tagged `integration` on Linux x86_64 with the library that Native built. It fails if it finds no integration test.
